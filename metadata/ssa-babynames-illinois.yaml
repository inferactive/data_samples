      Gender ratio before 1950s should be heavily skewed toward men because only "wage-earning heads of household" were initially eligible.

  - title: Diversity of babynames in modern years
    description: |
      Baby naming was more homogenous in past decades, e.g. for the state of Illinois, the most popular female name in 1960, "Mary", had 3570 records. In 2016, the most popular female name, "Olivia", had just 770.

      Correspondingly, there were 1171 female names in 1960 (with more than 5 records). In 2016, that number was 1852.

      Another way to look at it: percent of all names represented in the top 100 baby names in a given year.
