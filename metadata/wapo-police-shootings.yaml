  - title: Unarmed black men are disproportionately killed by police
    description: |
      A year after Michael Brown's shooting (2015), unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to die by police gunfire.

      According to the WaPo in 2015:

      "However, black men accounted for 40 percent of the 60 unarmed deaths, even though they make up just 6 percent of the U.S. population. The Post's analysis shows that black men were seven times more likely than white men to die by police gunfire while unarmed."
